        </div>
        <div>
        <p>When they hear about the plight of bees, many people want to help, but they aren't sure
            what to do. 
            Helping bees,
            and pollinators, is easy. If you have a <br><strong>10' x 12'</strong> mostly sunny spot in your backyard, you 
            can start a kitchen garden and grow heirloom seeds. 
            <img src="box1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            
            Most of our grandparents had kitchen gardens. Today, fewer than 20% of
            Amerian households have kitchen gardens. 
            
            
            There are many advantages to having kitchen gardens, all of
            which are hard to rank, but up at the top is feeding thousands of bees the heirloom pollen and nectar.

       </div>
       <div><p>At Save Bees, Grow Heirloom seeds, we did an experiment. We set up a 10' x 12' garden box. We decided
           we wanted to grow seedlings in peat pots, transfer them to four inch pots, and then plant them in the ground for
           maximum survival rate. Then, we planted ten heirloom seed collard plants, and let them flower. We were surprised to
           discover that while the collards were blooming, we fed thousands of bees a week, plus many butterflies and other
           insects.

      <div><h2>Installing a 10' x 12' Garden Box</h2></div>
      <img src="box2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            <p>Installing a 10' x 12' garden box doesn't take a lot of time. You don't even have to put 
            lot of effort into it. You can throw down newspapers or landscaping fabric, and cover with only
            an inch or two of soil, like Save Bees Grow Heirloom Seeds did to start their box.</p>
            <h3>To install a garden box, complete the following steps:</h3>
            <ol><li>Get four 10' x 12' boards. Decide whether to paint them to protect them from moisture.</li>
                <li>Get four corner brackets and enough screws to install the corner brackets. Using a hand-held power drill,
                    install the four corner brackets into the boards, and form a square out of the boards.
                <li>Prepare the soil, either by digging it up, by putting down newspapers, or by putting down
                    landscape fabric.
                </li>
                <li>Top with enough bagged soil to cover about one to two inches (we bought compost).</li>
                <li>Plant heirloom seeds in the soil.</li>
                <li>Water lightly, daily, particularly when the weather is warm and dry.</li>
                <li>Let the plants grow, and harvest produce as you wish, but let the plants flower, and go to seed.</li>
                </li>
                <li>When the plants flower, enjoy feeding thousands of bees a week.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>You can invest as much time as you want into your kitchen garden. You can find heirloom seed online. 
            Some nurseries
            carry them. Heirloom seeds require nuturing to grow, but they 
            do not require vasts amounts of water, fertlizer, or pesticides.

        <div><h2>Benefits of the Kitchen Garden</h2></div>

       <div><p>The kitchen garden has a pthleora of benefits, not the least of which, 
           if heirloom pollen and nectar is the very best for bees, besides from wildcrafted plants, 
           heirloom produce is the very best source of produce
           available for humans. While it's not feasible to completely source your nutritive
        needs from a kitchen garden, you can supplement your diet as much as you can with the 
    very best nurition available.</p></div>
        
         <div><p>Having a 10' x 12' kitchen garden is like a having a private tidepool, or acquarium, 
             in your backyard. You will be amazed at the amount of 
                  wildlife your 10' x 12' box supports. Our 10' x 12' garden box hosted aphids, 
                  ladybugs,
                  beatles, bees, snakes, and butterflies, to name a few. Standing near your box
                   when it is buzzing with bees, knowing you created that happy, healthy buzz,
                  is a rewarding sound like no other. Binoculars are recommended kitchen
                  garden box accessories. Sitting and bee watching
                  is fascinating.</p>
                  <p>The benefits of a kitchen garden are innumerable and without measure. Some of the benefits are listed below:</p>
                <li>Feeding bees, and pollinators, high-quality food.</li>
                <li>Gets you outside.
                </li>
                <li>Gets you more in synch with nature. </li>
                <li> 
                    When you <strong>#growyourown</strong>*, you know
                    what's in your food.
                </li>
                <li>There is nothing tastier than homegrown, fresh heirloom
                        vegetables.</li>
                <li>Gardening is well known for its therapetic and healing qualities.</li>
                <li>Excellent family activity.
                </li>
                <li>Provides excercise.</li>
            
              </ol></p>
              *<strong>#growyourown</strong> is a small movement, dedicated to homegrown produce.
