        </div>
        <div>
        Most of us have heard the grumblings about how Monsanto and a handful of other
            seed, pesticide, and fertilizer conglomerates are bad, but the sad reality is that we
            could not provide enough food for the 7.6 billion people on this planet without chemical
            fertilzer.
        
       </div>
      <div><h2>Hybrid Seeds</h2></div>
            Starting in the 1930's, hybrid seeds were developed by cross-pollinating plants over several decades,
            selecting for highest yield. At the time, the sheer driving force behind developing hybrids was figuring out a way
            to stop world-wide faminine, as world population swelled. Scientists worked feverishly, much as when a cure
            for polio was sought, to find a way to meet the food needs of the world's growing population. 
            Without the development of hybrid seeds, we would not have been able to meet the demands of world popluation 
            growth. Hybrid seeds prevented global faminine and starvation.
        <div><h2>The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions</h2></div>

       <div>Sadly, technological advances, which improve our quality of life,
          often have unintended consequences. In the case of hybrid seeds, a few
              unforeseen things occurred.
              <ul>

              <li>Hybrid seed produce very high yields the first year of growth. The second year, hybrid seed plants lose their "vigor", 
                requiring farmers to re-buy seeds year over year.</li>
                <li>Hybrid seeds require a lot of water, pesticides, and fertilizer to grow well.</li>
                <li>Farmers abandoned heirloom seeds for the next big thing: seeds producing high-yield, high-profits. 
                  As a result, the world, and humanity, experienced a mass extinction (over 75%) of region-specific, heirloom seeds. 
                  </li>
              </ul>
              </div>

              <div><h2>Where We Are Today</h2></div>

              <div><p>What started out as effort to stop world-wide hunger morphed into coporate interests 
                with a lot of money at stake.
                Today, our entire food chain has been posioned by the 
                fertilizers and pesticides used to prevent world hunger. Even organic
              food isn't truly organic. 
              There is a small movement to return to the kitchen gardens of our grandparents,
            grow heirloom organic produce, and save heirloom seeds.</p></div>

            <div><h2>What Does This Have to Do With Bees?!</h2></div>
            <div><h3 class="animated infinite flash">Absolutely Everything</h3></div> 


           <div><p> Bees, and pollinators, are dying in record numbers. No one knows for sure why. 
            The following reasons are currently believed contributors to bee extinction:
            <ul><li>Fertilizers</li>
              <li>Pesticides</li>
              <li>Mites</li>
              <li>Global warming</li>
              <li>Cell phone radio waves</li>
              <li class="animated infinite flash"><strong>Poor quality food</strong></li>
              
            </li></ul> Save Bees Grow Heirloom Seeds believes that heirloom pollen and nectar provides bees with the 
            best source of nutrition available.</p></div>
