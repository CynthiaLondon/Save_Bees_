        <div><h1><Strong>Hybrid vs. Heirloom</Strong></h1>
        </div>
        <div><p>
        Hybrid seeds were developed to meet burgeoning world population needs. If given lots of water, fertilizer, and pesticides,
        their first year of growth, they provide
          high yields. After the first year, however, their
         yields are unreliable, and they do not grow quality seed that can be used the following year. The nutrition
          provided by hybrid seeds is questionable.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div><p>Seed control switched from the people to a handful of multi-international corporations. These corporations run 98%
         of world-wide seed sales. Over time, they have patented seeds and lobbied for laws
         that make it illegal to save seeds. In 2000, genetically-modified seeds took over the commerical world-wide 
         market.</p>

       <div class="animated pulse infinite" id="quote"><strong>In the last four years, the chemical industy has spent $1.2 M on a PR initiative
         to say it is not their fault, so we know whose fault it is." <br> &#8212; John Cooksey 
        </strong></div>

      <div><h2>Heirloom Seeds</h2></div>
           <div>Heirloom seeds get passed on from generation to generation like family jewels. They are regional.
            They grow produce that is tastier than anything you have ever tasted. Heirloom seeds
            grow the same year over year, allowing growers to save their seeds for reuse.

        <div><h3>The 20th Century Great Seed Extinction</h3></div>
        <div><p>If you were alive in 1903, you would have been able to choose from more than 
          500 varieties of cabbage, 
          400 varieties of peas and tomatoes, 
          and 285 varieties of cucumbers. Peru used to have
          4,000 potato varieties. 

          By 1983, after the privitization of seeds, due to the introduction of hybrid seeds, 
          the available varieties were down to 28 types cabbage, 25 types of peas, 
          79 types of tomatoes, and a mere 16 types of cucumbers. </p>
         
        </div>
        <div><p>Researchers found 75% of heirloom seeds were lost over eight decades. U.S. consumers now have
            less than 1% of the seeds varieties that were available a century ago. Vandana Shiva, Cropecologist, estimates that we shrank from 80,000 species to
          8 species.</p></div>

        <div><p>We don't know for sure, but it seems like a reasonable conclusion that hybrid
          pollen is different than heirloom pollen, especially because of the loss of vigor.
          Here at Save Bees Grow Heirloom Seeds, we wonder whether decades of hybrid
          pollen has taken a toll on bee health over generations. Regardless, there is no doubt
          that heirloom pollen is superior to hybrid pollen. Hybrid pollen is a manufactured
          man-made type of junk food. Heirloom pollen is unadulterated.
        </p></div>

       <div><h4>Seed Savers</h4></div>
              <div>There is a growing movement to grow heirloom seeds and supply them to gardners for their
                use, to try to rebuild and perserve biodiversity. The average age of a seed saver is 70 years old. We need
                more seed savers. With a garden box, you can focus on a seed to save. Seed savers work with
                heirloom seed companies and grow seed to supply to others.
              </div>
             
      <div><h2>What's In Your Food?</h2></div>
      <div>The advantage to growing high-quality food for bees is that you also get to enjoy the best kind of food available. Kitchen gardeners who are part of the <strong>#growyourown</strong> movement 
        want to know what is in their food.
